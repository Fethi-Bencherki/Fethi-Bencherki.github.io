I am a PhD student at the Department of Automatic Control at Lund University and in the WASP (Wallenberg AI, autonomous systems and software program) graduate school. My main supervisor is [Anders Rantzer](https://www.control.lth.se/personnel/personnel/anders-rantzer/). I joined the department in September 2021. I have received an MSc in Control Theory (2021) from Eskisehir technical University

I am within the NEST project and my research interest revolves around developing scalable control approaches for large scale networks. I am also interested in learning-based control and the identification of switched systems.
